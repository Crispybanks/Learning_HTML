# learning_HTML
This repository contains files I created to learn HTML. They are organized to help me understand how HTML works, including its mechanics and tags, while practicing writing code.

# Disclaimer
The links in `https://crispybanks.github.io/learning_HTML/` are currently non-functional. Fixing this will take some time since it's not a priority and outside my current focus.
